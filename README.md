## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I could learn about the way in which a CSS Flexbox can be used to replicate a card design that is responsive.

### Continued development

This is a static component that can be used as a part of a larger website with more functionality.

### Useful resources
